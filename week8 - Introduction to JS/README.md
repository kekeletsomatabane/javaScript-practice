## JavaScript questions 

> **Note:**
>These questions  cover the concepts covered in Week 8 (Introduction to JS)

---

1. #### What happens when a variable is initialised without prior declaration in JavaScript and used in the program? 

1. #### The JS programming language is:

  - Interpreted
  - Compiled
  - Just-in-time compiled

3. #### True or false? 
  
   You can store any data type in a JS variable and the interpreter determines the type at runtime.

4. #### True or false? 

   There is an error with this code: 
   ```javascript
   let name = 'John Doe', age = 22, hasCar = true;
   ```

5. #### True or false? 

    Variables declared with ‘const’ must be initialised immediately. 

6. #### True or false?

    Variable 'a' is a Boolean type.
   ```javascript
   const a = 'true';
   ```

7. #### The result of this operation is 131

   ```javascript
   let solution = 125 + '6';
   ``` 

8. #### What is logged to the console and why?

   ```javascript 
   let result2 = 10 / '2 apples';
   console.log(result2);

   let result3 = 10 / '5';
   console.log(result3);
   ```

9. #### True or false?
 
   The toFixed( ) method always returns a string.

### Bonus question:

10. #### These two expressions evaluate to the same value

    ```javascript
    let x = 5 ** 2;
    let y = Math.pow(5, 2);
    ```
